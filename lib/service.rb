# Services are defined from the config/umlaut_config/services.yml file.
# hey should have the following properties
# id : unique internal string for the service, unique in yml file
# display_name : user displayable string
# url : A base url of some kind used by specific service
# type : Class name of class found in lib/service_adaptors to be used for logic
# priority: 0-9 (foreground) or a-z (background) for order of service operation
#
# Specific service_adaptor classes may have specific addtional configuration,
# commonly including 'password' or 'api_key'.
# specific service can put " required_config_parms :param1, :param2"
# in definition, for requirement exception raising on initialize.
#
# = Service Sub-classes
# Can include required config params in the class definition, eg:
#     required_config_params :api_key, :base_url
#
# Should define #service_types_generated returning an array of
# ServiceTypeValues.  This is neccesary for the Service to be
# run as a background service, and have the auto background updater
# work.
#
# The vast majority of services are 'standard' services, however
# there are other 'tasks' that a service can be. Well, right now, one
# other, 'link_out_filter'. The services 'task' config property
# sets the task/function/hook of the service. Default is 'standard'.
#
# A standard service defines handle(request)
#
# A link_out_filter service defines link_out_filter(request, url). If service
# returns a new url from filter_url, that's the url the user will be directed
# to. If service returns original url or nil, original url will still be used.
