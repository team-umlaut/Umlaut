SearchMethods
===
SearchMethods' allow Umlaut to search an arbitrary data source for A-Z Journals.
Implementations must adhere to the following method signatures.
The module is included in the SearchController and has access to instance methods and
instance variables from the SearchController.

These class methods are used only in the `:load_sfx_urls` rake task.
They are expected to be deprecated in future Umlaut releases.

  - `::fetch_urls?() `==> `Boolean` <br>
  Returns a Boolean indicating whether the module will return URLs
  
  - `::fetch_urls()` ==> `Array<String>` <br>
  Returns an array of strings representing URLs that are "owned" by the search
  system

Instance Methods:
---
  - `#find_by_title()` ==> `[Array<OpenURL::ContextObject>, integer]` <br>
  Returns a two element array consisting of an Array of OpenURL::ContextObject
  and the total count of records returned by the search
  
  - `#find_by_group()` ==> `[Array<OpenURL::ContextObject>, integer]` <br>
